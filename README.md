# SQL Analytics Project  (Work in Progress)

This repository contains an in-progress SQL business analytics project designed to showcase practical SQL skills using a realistic, synthetic business database.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how SQL is used in real-world analytics and data engineering workflows — including schema design, data modeling, complex querying, and answering business-driven questions — rather than simple textbook examples.

> Status: 🚧 Actively under development  
> New tables, data, and queries are being added incrementally.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a retail / e-commerce business environment with multiple related tables such as customers, orders, products, and payments. Using this data, I write SQL queries to answer common business questions around revenue, customer behavior, and operational performance.

The emphasis is on:
- Clean, readable SQL
- Proper joins and relationships
- Analytical thinking
- Queries that reflect real business use cases

---

## Planned Database Structure

The synthetic database will include tables such as:

- `customers`
- `orders`
- `order_items`
- `products`
- `payments`
- `stores` 
- `promotions`
- `refunds` 

The schema is intentionally designed to support one-to-many relationships and realistic analytics scenarios.

## Example Business Questions (Planned)

Queries in this repository will explore questions like:

- Total revenue by day, week, and month
- Average order value trends
- Top customers by lifetime value
- Repeat vs one-time customer behavior
- Product performance over time
- Payment method usage
- Refund and return rates
- Customer cohort analysis

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **SQL** (PostgreSQL-style syntax)
- **Local database** (PostgreSQL)
- **Python** for synthetic data generation



---
## Project Status

This repository is **not finished** and is being built incrementally.  
The focus is on correctness, clarity, and realistic analytics rather than speed.

Future updates will include:
- Expanded datasets
- Additional analytical queries
- More advanced SQL (CTEs, window functions, date logic)
- Query optimization and documentation

---

## Purpose

This project is intended for:
- Portfolio demonstration
- SQL interview preparation
- Practicing real-world analytics workflows
- Showcasing SQL proficiency beyond academic examples

Feel free to explore the repository as it evolves.
